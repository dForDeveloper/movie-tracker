## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for usage and testing purposes. 

Create a movie tracker folder locally:
```
mkdir movie-tracker
```
Clone the project within your new directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dForDeveloper/movie-tracker.git
```
Additionally, clone this repo within the movie-tracker directory for the backend, following all associated instructions:
```
https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker
```
After the backend is set up, start the backend server locally:
```
$ npm start
```
In a new terminal window, change directories to the frontend folder to install modules within:
```
$ npm install
```
Start the frontend server with the following command:
```
$ npm start
```

Finally, view the application at localhost:3001 in your browser. Enjoy!


## Project Development Notes:
Movie Tracker was built using React, React Router, Redux, and Redux thunks. It stores user login information and favorites via a local server. As an introduction to multi-page applications, the learning goals included becoming familiar with Router and Redux. Our team especially focused on writing simple, straightforward React code (including streamlined fetch requests). 

## Future Development and Extensions Notes:
In the future, we would like to deploy the project with a server-side backend. We would like to do this via node.js and Heroku.
